# approx
This repository contains libraries in `C`¹, `C++`¹, `C#`¹, `Go`¹ (Golang), `Java`¹, `Julia`¹ (JuliaLang), and `Python`¹ for approximations of roots to degree-*n* polynomials. 
To approximate roots to non-polynomials, input the **Taylor Series** around the root or the **Maclaurin Series** (**Taylor Series** around `0`).
